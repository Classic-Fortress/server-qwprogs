The New TeamFortress Entity Reference Sheet                  TF Version 2.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a reference sheet for people who're trying to read/debug the
entities on their TF map. It's simply a quick description of every variable
for all the TF entities. It's simply a quick-reference. For full details,
see the tfortmap.txt file.

Print this out, and keep it by you whenever you're reading through someone
else's .map file to see how they did something :)  Also get Raistlan's EntEd
which supports TeamFortress Entities at http://www.lockandload.com/ented/

                        If they are owner of the Item, team_str_home will be
                        used. Refer to the "owned_by" variable for GoalItems.
                        e.g. "The enemy flag is being carried by" < player's_name>

                        the goal will not effect anybody. Bitfields:
                                 1 : Illegal for Timer Goals
                                 2 : Illegal for Timer Goals

                                 8 : Illegal for Timer Goals
                                16 : Radius effect (see "t_length") does not go
                                        through walls.

                                        Goal, don't affect him. Environments are air,
                                        water, slime, lava. e.g. If a Goal is above
                                        some water, and does a radius effect with
                                        "t_length", and a player in the water is within
                                        the radius, he won't be affected if this bit
                                        is set.
                                64 : If this bit is set, then instead of just applying

                                        specified by the other "goal_effects" variable,
                                        this Goal checks it's criteria for each player
                                        in the group and then applies it's results

============================================================================
OTHER QUAKE ENTITY VARIABLES
============================================================================


func_button / func_door
                        This works the same as info_tfgoal except for obvious
                        variables such as "model".  Additional Bitfields:
        goal_activation         8 : only activated when hit by an engineer's spanner
        forcecloseonblock       1 : when blocked by a player or item, keep attempting to close

trigger_push
        This can now be paired with a targetname of a point entity called target_position - this will create Q3 style jumppads
        spawnflags:     2 : include TFItems (So flags can be affected)
                        4 : exclude "other" (So only TFItems are affected)
                        8 : "no noise" make sure no default noise is added

func_wall
        spawnflags:     1 : make wall non solid
                        2 : WALL_HIDE_ON_USE
trigger_jumppad
        Rename of trigger_push, can be used to allow for "Fortress One" only trigger_push entities that won't be misinterpreted by other fortress mods


OTHER ENTITIES          Most Quake entities work the same as info_tfgoal except
                        for obvious variables such as "model", "goal_no", and
                        "goal_activation" fields.  So you can limit func_doors to
                        certain team_nos and so on...
