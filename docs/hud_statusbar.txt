The status bar shows TF-specific info, and it works in different ways depending on the client:
For fte, it will detect that csqc is active and send messages directly to the csqc part of the client to display individual HUD icons and statuses.
For ezquake (and basically everything else), it will use a centerprint hack to permanently display the status bar.

It can be enabled using the client setting
    setinfo sb 40
(or any positive integer). The integer is relevant for the non-fte version, as it dictates how many empty "lines" to skip before drawing it, thus allowing basic control of its veritcal position.

A specific sub-component can be enabled using the command
    setinfo sbflaginfo 1|2
Setting it to 0 will turn it off, setting it to 1 will enable it, but only 6 seconds after spawn (after the class tips finish displaying) and a setting of 2 will make it permanent.

The sb flaginfo will display the current status of any flags/item_tfgoals that have been tagged by the mapper. The logic is the same as the stock "flaginfo" command, which is marking up to 4 goalitems in the info_tfdetect
entity using the fields display_item_status1 - display_item_status4 using the items' goal_no numbers. This is further documented in the tf reference docs.
This does limit the number of trackable items to 4 however.
The flaginfo functionality is extended by having it also display who it's currenly carried by, or, if dropped, the location (based on the loc file) and time to return.
Note that currently, the item names are hard-coded to be "blue/red/yellow/green flag", to cover most cases, where mappers didn't necessarily name them nicely.

The sb flaginfo component also displays the "button" countdowns (such as lasers/security being down), if available, and there is room.
This functions in a similar way to the flag info, but, while technically unlimited, 
the combined number of all sbar items (flags and buttons) is 10 for fte and 6 for ezquake.
For ezquake, the buttons will be distinguished by name, and will not appear until they are actually triggered and have a countdown active.
For fte, the buttons are distinguished by team colours and will display a different icon to the flag, but otherwise function similarly.

For a map to allow these to be tracked, the following needs to be set for each button:
- It must be set on an info_tfgoal entity
- It must have the field "track_goal" be set to 1
- It must have a "goal_no" field set
- It must have the field "delay_time" set to the countdown time
- It must be triggered at the start of the countdown either via goal_no or targetname. It doesn't have to be part of the main trigger chain however.
- For ezquake, it must have a "netname" field set to distinguish the goals.
- For FTE, it should have the "owned_by" field set which will determine the icon colour.
- Optionally, it can have the field "team_str_moved" set to set a custom string to be displayed while the countdown is active. If not set, the default is "Offline". 

For FTE, the icons for the above are in the same location as the normal hud elements:
ie fortress/textures/wad/
They are named "flag_<teamno>" for the flag icons and "off_icon_glow_<teamno>" for the button icons.
